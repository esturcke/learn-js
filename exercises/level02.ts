// Level 2: Boolean Logic and conditionals

/**
 * Exercise 1
 *
 * Booleans have two possible `true` or `false`. Write a function that returns
 * `true` if two numbers are equal and `false` if two numbers are not equal.
 * JavaScript uses `===` to check if things are equal.
 *
 * @see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Strict_equality
 */
export const ex1 = (a: number, b: number) => {
  return null;
};

/**
 * Exercise 2
 *
 * You can create branches in code by using `if...else`
 *
 * ```
 * if (boolean) {
 *   // if it's `true` do this
 * }
 * else {
 *   // if `false` do this
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Create a function that finds the difference between numbers (bigger minus smaller)
 *
 * @see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else
 */
export const ex2 = (a: number, b: number) => {
  return null;
};

/**
 * Exercise 3
 *
 * You can also express AND (as `&&` in JavaScript), OR (as `||`) and NOT (as `!`)
 * to form more complex expressions.
 *
 * Create a function that:
 *
 *   1. for even positive numbers returns half the number
 *   2. for even negative numbers returns the number times itself
 *   3. for odd positive numbers, add one and divide by two
 *   4. for all other numbers return 0
 *
 * Hint: to check if something is odd, think about the remainder when dividing by 2.
